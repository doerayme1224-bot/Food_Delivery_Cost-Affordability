in this dataset, iwanna learn more about profits, specifically regariding the food delivery industry
I also want to utilize more quantitative data as i fell as though i have only really seen qualitative data in the many datasets that i have gotten.
Questions:                                          
1.what does the payment processing fee refer to
2.Does the payment method affect their profits
3.By how much would the extra fees distort the price
4.By how much do discounts distort prices
hypothesis
Im am going to make a educated guess that while the extra fees do noticeably distort the price, they do not influence its order value by more than 5 dollars
